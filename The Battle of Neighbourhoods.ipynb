This comes down to a combination of restaurant style, target audience, as well as presence of competitors in the area. By defining the restaurant type, you can identify the target demographic and where this demographic is most populated.\n\nTarget market:\nTo open an asian restaurant in london, you must identify who you are aiming to attract to your venue. Will the audience be of Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese and Indian origin? You must be aware of the age group, location and amount of money this audience will be willing to spend.\n\nCompetitors:\nYou must identify competitors in the chosen area and identify what they are doing well and what needs to be improved. You need to be better than them.\n\nConsider opening the restaurant in an area where there are not already many similar restuarants in the area, as this would reduce chances of success. Look for an area with a gap in the market. However, if there are no similar restaurants in the area, then why not? Do some research to ensure this is the best location.\n\nLocation and premises:\nHere are some factors that you should consider when finding premises for your new restaurant:\n- Location: how acccessible? Are there many competitors nearby?\n- Building type: what type of building would you like your restaurant to be in?\n- Target market: ensure it is in an area where your target market exists.\n- Cost: realistic price point"
